WordPress plugin to use reCAPTCHA to help protect comments and new user signups
against spam.


== Description ==

e11 reCAPTCHA is a no-frills way to add Google's reCAPTCHA widget to the
standard WordPress comment form and/or the user registration page.  By default
it will require only logged-out users to solve CAPTCHAs on comments and new
users to solve a CAPTCHA to successfully register on the site; it's also
possible to configure e11 reCAPTCHA to not require CAPTCHA solving in
either of these two forms or to require it on comments by all users.


== Installation ==

1. The plugin needs two keys from your Google reCAPTCHA account in order to
   connect to the service.  If you don't have an account yet,
   [please create one now.](https://www.google.com/recaptcha)  Otherwise, log
   into your account.
2. Ensure the website you will be running this plugin on is registered under
   your Google reCAPTCHA account and set to use "reCAPTCHA V2" for validation.
3. Open the registration page for your website, and look for the section
   "Adding reCAPTCHA to your site", then expand the "Keys" section.  Note the
   "Site key" and "Secret key" fields -- the e11 reCAPTCHA plugin will require
   these.
4. On your WordPress site, upload the plugin files to the
   "/wp-content/plugins/e11-recaptcha" directory, or install the plugin
   through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
5. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" screen in WordPress.
6. Use the "Settings->e11 reCAPTCHA screen" to configure the plugin, making sure
   to supply the "Site key" and "Secret key" parameters here.


== Screenshots ==

1. The plugin can be configured to define when reCAPTCHA forms will be
   presented to a user.
2. The reCAPTCHA widget on the registration page is scaled through CSS to fit
   the layout of the form.
3. The reCAPTCHA widget on the comment form appears after the comment
   <textarea> element.
