ReCAPTCHA WordPress plugin to help protect comments and new user signups
against spam.


== Description ==

e11 reCAPTCHA is a quick way to add Google's reCAPTCHA widget to comment
forms and/or the user registration page.  By default it will require
only logged-out users to solve CAPTCHAs on comments and new users to
solve a CAPTCHA to successfully register on the site.  It is also
possible to configure e11 reCAPTCHA to not require CAPTCHA solving in
either of these two forms or to require it on comments by all users.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the '/wp-content/plugins/e11-recaptcha'
   directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins
   screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Use the Settings->e11 ReCAPTCHA screen to configure the plugin.
